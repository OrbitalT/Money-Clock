# Money-Clock
A real time money clock, set your hourly pay and watch the money you make every second of every hour.

# Why?
Have you ever wanted to visualy see the money you make every second, minute and hour of the day? Well this does just that, a small electron app that will display in real time the money you make.

# Where
This will be a windows only app and maybe linux(I dont have mac so if someone wants to help feel free)
- Desktop app (GUI with counter and settings)
- Icon Counter in Tray
- Will somehow pair with or make a standalone desk Flip Clock (Raspberry pi, pico, esp2866, esp32)
